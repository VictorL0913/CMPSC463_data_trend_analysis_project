# Financial Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project addresses the challenge of analyzing large volumes of financial data to extract meaningful insights, detect patterns, and identify anomalies. In today's financial markets, the ability to quickly process large amounts of data is important for making investment decisions.

### Problem Statement

Financial Challenges:
1. Processing large datasets efficiently
2. Identifying trends and patterns in stock price movements
3. Detecting anomalies that could indicate market shifts or trading opportunities
4. Determining periods of maximum gain for optimal entry and exit points

### Project Goals

The primary goals of this analysis are to:
1. Develop a system that can efficiently handle and process large financial datasets
2. Implement algorithms to sort data, detect anomalies, and identify periods of maximum gain
3. Provide clear, actionable insights through data visualization and reporting
4. Create a tool that can be applied to various stocks for comparative analysis

## Type-Specific Considerations

### Financial Datasets

This project utilizes stock price data obtained from the Alpha Vantage API. Considerations for the dataset include:
- Daily closing prices are used as the primary metric for analysis
- The system is designed to handle time-series data with date-indexed entries
- Data is limited to approximately the last 100 trading days due to API constraints

### Algorithms and Data Structures

The project employs several key algorithms and data structures:

1. Merge Sort Algorithm:
   - Used for efficient sorting of the time-series data
   - Chosen for its O(n log n) time complexity, making it suitable for large datasets
   - Implemented using a divide-and-conquer approach

2. Closest Pair Algorithm:
   - Applied for anomaly detection in stock price movements
   - Utilizes a divide-and-conquer strategy to efficiently find the closest pair of points
   - Helps identify sudden price changes that indicate anomalies

3. Kadane's Algorithm:
   - Employed to find the maximum subarray, representing the period of maximum gain
   - Offers an O(n) complexity for finding the most profitable time period

4. Data Structures:
   - Pandas DataFrames are used for storing and manipulating the time-series data
   - NumPy arrays are utilized for numerical computations and data transformations

### Performance Considerations

- Divide-and-conquer techniques are used to improve performance on large datasets
